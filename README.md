# ðŸŒŸ Pre-Hackathon Project: Social Media Performance Analysis
Objective
This project was developed as part of a pre-hackathon assignment for the Level Supermind Hackathon. It focuses on creating a basic analytics module to analyze mock social media engagement data using Langflow and DataStax Astra DB.

The primary goal is to leverage AI-powered insights and cloud database operations to provide actionable feedback on social media post performance.

# Key feature
Fetch Engagement Data:

Simulated social media dataset with metrics like likes, shares, and comments.
Stored the dataset in DataStax Astra DB for efficient querying and analytics.
Analyze Post Performance:

Built a Langflow workflow to query Astra DB.
Calculated average engagement metrics for different post types.
Generate Insights:

Integrated GPT-powered Langflow workflows for natural language insights.
Example Insights:
Carousel posts: 20% higher engagement than static posts.
Reels: Drive 2x more comments than other formats.
Tech Stack and Tools Used:

DataStax Astra DB: Scalable NoSQL database for data storage and queries.
Streamlit: Interactive front-end to display real-time insights.
Generative AI (GPT): Analyzed trends and delivered user-friendly insights.
How It Works:

Data Simulation and Storage: Created a mock dataset uploaded to Astra DB.
Langflow Workflow: Designed to accept user input, query Astra DB, and process results with GPT.
Insight Generation: Delivered post-performance trends to optimize content strategy.
