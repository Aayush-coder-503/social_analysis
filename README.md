# üåü Pre-Hackathon Project: Social Media Performance Analysis
Objective
This project was developed as part of a pre-hackathon assignment for the Level Supermind Hackathon. It focuses on creating a basic analytics module to analyze mock social media engagement data using Langflow and DataStax Astra DB.

The primary goal is to leverage AI-powered insights and cloud database operations to provide actionable feedback on social media post performance.

# ‚ùáÔ∏è Key feature
Fetch Engagement Data: Simulated a social media dataset with metrics (likes, shares, comments) stored in DataStax Astra DB for efficient analytics.
Analyze Post Performance: Used Langflow workflows to query Astra DB and calculate average engagement metrics by post type.
Generate Insights: Integrated GPT-powered workflows to deliver natural language insights, such as "Carousel posts achieve 20% higher engagement" or "Reels drive 2x more comments."
Tech Stack: Utilized Langflow for no-code GPT workflows, Astra DB for scalable storage, Streamlit for real-time insights, and GPT for trend analysis.
Workflow: Simulated data storage, queried via Langflow, and processed results with GPT to optimize content strategies.
